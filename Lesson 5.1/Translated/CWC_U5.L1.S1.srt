(synthetic vibrations)

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,310
- [Narrator] Now let's make
our fifth prototype project.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,290
We're going to open up
Unity Hub once again.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,313
Once the application is opened,

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,033
we're going to create a new project.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,200
We're still making a 3D project.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,960
This will be Prototype 5.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,728
Make sure you save it
in the right location,

9
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:29,420
in that folder we were using
for all of our other projects.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,403
Select Create.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,840
Now Unity has set up
our new empty project.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,528
So, if you head back over to
the webpage for the tutorial,

13
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:45,410
download the asset package,
either through the asset store

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,063
or through the direct download.

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,593
Import all of the different
assets for Prototype 5.

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,573
Close the asset store tab.

17
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,120
In your Assets folder
in the project window,

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,490
select your Scenes folder,

19
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,133
open up Prototype 5,

20
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,390
delete your SampleScene.

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,223
Now let's reposition to our camera.

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,070
So now you can see our
background for Prototype 5.

23
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,710
In fact, our camera is
currently set to this 2D view,

24
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,950
so we can actually just
set our scene view to 2D.

25
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,900
This will, in fact, actually
make it easier for us

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,610
to interact with this scene.

27
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,640
Because while we do have
3D objects we're using,

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,200
we're generally just going to be working

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,300
on this 2D plane, here.

30
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,240
We could have done that for
some of our other projects,

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,350
but it's always good to get comfortable

32
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,260
moving things around in the 3D space.

33
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,520
In fact, if we select our move tool now

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,970
and select our Background, for example.

35
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,810
We actually only have arrows
for the y and the x-axis.

36
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,845
There's no z-axis because we
can't go forwards or backwards.

37
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:09,020
We can only go up, down, left or right.

38
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,819
And then, one more thing that we can do,

39
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:13,690
if you want to, go to your Course Library

40
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,490
in your Assets folder.

41
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,071
In the Textures folder, expand that

42
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,640
and there's actually all
these different textures

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,473
that we can use.

44
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:23,163
So, for example, I could replace

45
00:02:23,163 --> 00:02:26,133
these dark panels on the side.

46
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,780
Then I could make my center panel

47
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,600
have a dark background.

48
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,310
For now, I'm just going
to leave it as it was.

49
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,790
So I'm going to undo all that.

50
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,938
And now we're ready to get started.

51
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:48,058
So, what you're gonna
do is open up Unity Hub,

52
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:50,403
create a new project,

53
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,024
make it 3D, rename it to Prototype 5

54
00:02:56,024 --> 00:02:58,563
and make sure it's saved
in the right location.

55
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,130
Once Unity sets up your empty project,

56
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,550
head over to the tutorial webpage,

57
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,464
download the starter package,

58
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:09,457
either through the asset
store or direct download,

59
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,786
import your asset package.

60
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:16,010
Once the package is imported,
open up your Scenes folder,

61
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,921
open Prototype 5, delete your SampleScene.

62
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:23,921
Set your scene view to 2D
with the little 2D button

63
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,040
in the top left of our scene view.

64
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,561
And then, if you want, you
can go into the Assets folder

65
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:34,980
underneath Course Library,
open up that textures folder

66
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,430
and you can apply different
textures to the background

67
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,247
just by left clicking and dragging them

68
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:44,470
onto either of the panels
or that main middle section

69
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,420
if you want to change the colors around.

70
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,373
Now it's your turn.

71
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:51,765
