1
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,640
- All of the pieces of our prototype

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,430
are functioning perfectly.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,810
The player, the enemy, the power up.

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,690
All flawless.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,960
The problem is that we can

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,460
only experience this
functionality very briefly,

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,890
because as soon as you
knock the first enemy off,

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,990
that's it.

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,290
The game's over.

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,353
The player wins.

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,170
If I know these enemy
spheres like I think I do,

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,223
they shouldn't go down without a fight,

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,030
so by the end of this lesson,

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,540
whenever all enemies are destroyed,

15
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,690
a new wave of enemies will spawn

16
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,540
with one more enemy than the wave before,

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,963
gradually increasing
the game's difficulty.

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,750
In order to spawn all of these enemies,

19
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,170
we'll have to call the instantiate method

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,440
a whole bunch of times.

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,680
What you could do is just
write that line of code

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,810
over and over again,

23
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,700
but as you probably guessed,

24
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,350
that's not the best way to do it.

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,433
Instead, we'll use
something called a for-loop,

26
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,680
which will loop through some code

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,093
for as many times as we specify.

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,150
The really great thing about for-loops,

29
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,560
as opposed to just writing
the same line of code

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,630
over and over again,

31
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,330
is that you can use a variable

32
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,850
to dynamically change the number of times

33
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,770
the for-loop will run.

34
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,590
So in the first wave,

35
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,890
we'll make the for-loop run
once to create one enemy.

36
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,850
In the second wave,

37
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,940
it will run twice to spawn two enemies.

38
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,960
In the third wave,

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,640
we can have it run three times

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,853
to spawn three enemies and so on.

41
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,450
So to make all that happen,

42
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,713
I'll see you in Unity.
