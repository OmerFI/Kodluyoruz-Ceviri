1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,499
(futuristic noises)

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,330
- [Narrator] So we have our
script for our target set up.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,360
We're just gonna do a
little bit of clean-up

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,940
just because we have a lot
of these different methods,

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,240
and we have a lot of
different hard values,

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,490
so we're going to make our
code just a bit more readable.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,630
So we have values for our Speed,

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,980
we have values for our Torque
that we're gonna apply.

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,080
We have a Range for x position,

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,220
and we have our Spawn position,

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,630
so we'll just create a
bunch of those variables.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,630
So we'll make a private
float for our minSpeed,

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
our minimum speed.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,223
And we'll set this to 12 for now.

15
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,140
We'll make another float for our max

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,110
and this will be 16.

17
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,510
For our Torque, we'll
make a torque variable

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,693
and we'll set this to be 10.

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,170
And then we have a Range
that our x can spawn in

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,293
and we have a position for our y.

21
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,600
Now, we'll go in and replace
all these values really quick

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,590
so in our Random.Range for our AddForce,

23
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,240
we're going to change our
12 to be the minimum speed

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,913
that we want our objects to move.

25
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,630
And then we'll change the
16 to the maximum speed

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,860
across our Random.Range.

27
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,450
For our Torque, we'll apply our max torque

28
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,310
for the negative values

29
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,713
and the positive values.

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,783
So this way, it's just using maxTorque

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,600
to see the Range that it should

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,753
be creating random numbers at.

33
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,960
And then finally, for our position,

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,290
we'll change the Range
that our object spawns at

35
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:23,290
to our xRange between
negative four and four

36
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,750
and then we can just
remove the negative six

37
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,883
so we'll make this the actual ySpawnPos.

38
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,940
Now, if we wanted to make our code

39
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,120
a little bit more readable,

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,780
we could create random variables
for the x Random Torque,

41
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,930
y Random Torque, and z Random Torque.

42
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,870
That doesn't really save us
any lines of code really,

43
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,320
so it's not entirely useful to do.

44
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,900
But what we can do is since we have

45
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,450
all of these different lines

46
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,000
that are each doing one specific task,

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,360
we can put these into methods
to make it a bit easier

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,470
for when we need to use them.

49
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,470
So, we'll make a new Vector3 method

50
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,900
so that way we can return to Vector3.

51
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,143
And this will be for our RandomForce,

52
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,150
so here' where we'll
calculate a RandomForce

53
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,870
and then send it back to us.

54
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,630
And then in fact, we
can just have it return

55
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,970
this entire line of code in our AddForce.

56
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,510
So we'll cut that with Ctrl or Command X,

57
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,823
paste it down in RandomForce
with Ctrl or Command V,

58
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,490
and now in our AddForce method,

59
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,253
we can actually just call
our RandomForce method.

60
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,920
We can do the same thing for the Torque,

61
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,160
since Random just returns a float,

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,730
we'll use our float,
call this RandomTorque

63
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,073
so it generates a different
Torque value every time.

64
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,593
Could actually just take our Random.Range,

65
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,940
have it return that Random.Range

66
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,217
and then we can just call RandomTorque.

67
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,020
And then, if we just cut
out all the random ranges,

68
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,380
then we'll just paste
our RandomTorque method

69
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,210
into each of those different parameters.

70
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,390
And then, last but not least,

71
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,470
since we're creating a
random spawn position,

72
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,070
we can just use a method to do that too.

73
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,010
So, again, we'll create another Vector3,

74
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,423
since we're using a Vector3.

75
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,150
We could take where we create

76
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,350
our actual random spawn position,

77
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,253
if we cut that out of our start method.

78
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,140
In our Vector3 we return and then we paste

79
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,470
that entire line of code.

80
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,740
Now, one thing you might notice

81
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,210
between our RandomSpawnPos method,

82
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,550
that returns Vector3, and
RandomForce that returns Vector3,

83
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,500
is that our RandomForce does
not use the new keyword,

84
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,760
versus our RandomSpawnPos, which does.

85
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,660
That's because, with RandomForce,

86
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,660
because we're multiplying a
Vector3 that already exists,

87
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,550
and multiplying it by values,

88
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,310
we can return that Vector3 immediately.

89
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,840
In our RandomSpawnPos,

90
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,883
because we're actually
creating a new Vector3,

91
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,610
we actually need to use the new keyword

92
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,610
to create a new Vector3 variable

93
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,793
with values that we can then use.

94
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,110
And then in our transform.position,

95
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,393
we can just call RandomSpawnPos.

96
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,320
So, now our code is a lot more clean

97
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,770
in the places where we're really

98
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,640
using our different methods.

99
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,250
It's much easier to
read, we have variables

100
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,823
so we can change them whenever we need to.

101
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,113
And then, in our different helper methods,

102
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,267
we're doing different things
like calculating a RandomForce

103
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,830
so that we can use it, or a RandomTorque,

104
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,800
or a RandomPos.

105
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,750
Now it's your turn.
