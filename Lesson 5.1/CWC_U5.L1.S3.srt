00:00:00,437 --> 00:00:02,937
(logo chimes)

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,342
- [Instructor] So, we have each of our

3
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:10,073
different prefabs
created and we've applied

4
00:00:10,073 --> 00:00:11,609
our components to them.

5
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:14,390
So now we're actually going to use

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,748
our target script to control

7
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:19,090
the force that they move in the air,

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,520
the random position that they start

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,892
off at the bottom of the scene,

10
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:25,630
and then torque to be
able to rotate the object.

11
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,566
If you double-click on your target script

12
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:31,321
now with our target script open

13
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:33,454
we're going to create some variables.

14
00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:37,040
So we're going to create
a private variable

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,840
for our rigid body

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,945
so that we can just find
it using get component.

17
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:44,889
And we'll call this targetRb since

18
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:46,720
each one of our different objects

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,620
are the different targets
we're trying to hit.

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,930
And our start method we're going to take

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,385
targetRb and we'll set it to be

22
00:00:55,385 --> 00:01:00,223
the component on our object
which is our rigid body.

23
00:01:01,358 --> 00:01:04,220
Now that we have our rigid body component,

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,265
we need to apply a force on our object

25
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:08,057
so that when it spawns it moves up

26
00:01:08,057 --> 00:01:10,574
in our scene so that it can fall down.

27
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:13,732
So using our target rigid body

28
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:16,889
we're going to add a force

29
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:19,240
in this case our force is going

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,000
to be in the up direction

31
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:26,230
and we'll multiply this
by a random value for now

32
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,260
so we're actually going to use

33
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,290
our random range method

34
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,690
and we'll set it just to task,

35
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,870
we'll use 12 as the lowest
value that it could be

36
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,630
and 16 as the highest.

37
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,465
We actually want this
force applied instantly

38
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:43,690
so we'll use a force mode

39
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,210
and we'll use our impulse.

40
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,930
Another thing that we wanna do

41
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,610
is we actually want this object to

42
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,680
rotate and move as it
gets through our scene.

43
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,532
So we're gonna use our rigid body again,

44
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:02,073
this time we're actually
going to use torque.

45
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:06,468
So add torque and so torque will actually

46
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:10,140
apply the force for our objects to rotate.

47
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,320
In this case we just need the directions

48
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,480
that the torque will be applied in

49
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,160
so we'll use random ranges for

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,635
our x, our y, and our z.

51
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:23,635
So we're randomly generate a value

52
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,750
that it will rotate in

53
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,610
say negative ten and ten,

54
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,210
so that's on the x.

55
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,295
We need to generate another random value

56
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:34,730
I'm just going to actually reuse this bit

57
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,143
of code so I'm actually
just gonna copy this.

58
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:41,297
I'll paste it into our Y value

59
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:43,516
and then I'll paste it into our Z value

60
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:45,550
so our x, our y, and our z

61
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,484
are all calculating
different random values

62
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,910
between negative ten and ten.

63
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,020
Again, we want this
force applied instantly

64
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,133
so I'll actually use another force mode.

65
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,705
And then we want to set the position

66
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:03,432
of our object randomly on our x.

67
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:05,575
Finally, what we're gonna do is

68
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:07,111
we're going to create a random

69
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:11,040
place for our different object to spawn.

70
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,810
So we're going to get the position

71
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,610
of our current object and we'll set

72
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,271
this to be a new vector three

73
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:23,000
and for the x it'll be a random range

74
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,401
so I'll try and keep it between

75
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:31,573
negative four and four.

76
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,620
This way it stays between the

77
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,233
left and right side of our screen

78
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:39,623
for our y value, we'll set it to

79
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:41,650
something like negative six

80
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,840
that way it spawns underneath the scene

81
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,633
and then for our z value
we can set it to zero.

82
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,983
Now if we wanna test
and see how this looks,

83
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,530
we can actually drag our prefabs

84
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,520
into our hierarchy and it'll randomly

85
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,883
create those effects.

86
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,690
So it has a random position,

87
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,783
it's got the random force applied.

88
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:10,900
Now one little bit of clarity

89
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,020
that we can actually add,

90
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,500
so since we're not actually using

91
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,640
the z value here,

92
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,490
we can actually remove this

93
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,199
and since we're not really moving

94
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,697
anything on the z in general,

95
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,540
in this case it'll set the
x to be a random range,

96
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,530
the Y will be negative six

97
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,036
underneath what our player can see

98
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:33,810
and our z is always just gonna be zero.

99
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,175
So what you're gonna do is

100
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:39,130
in your target script you're going to

101
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,248
create a rigid body variable,

102
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,741
you're gonna get the reference

103
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,330
for that rigid body component,

104
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,240
now that you have your
rigid body component

105
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,419
add a force in the up direction

106
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:53,710
using a random strength between 12 an 16

107
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,630
and make sure that you apply

108
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,660
the force with an impulse.

109
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,640
In our next line of code

110
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,480
we're going to add torque to apply

111
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,090
rotation to our object

112
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,096
and we're just going to use

113
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,784
randomly generated values for all

114
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:09,387
the different x, y, and z.

115
00:05:09,387 --> 00:05:12,203
Then we're going to set the position

116
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:16,427
of our object to be a random range

117
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:19,080
on our x and just below what our player

118
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,550
can see on the y.

119
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,101
Now it's your turn.

120
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:24,601
