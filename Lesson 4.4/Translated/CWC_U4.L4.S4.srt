1
00:00:00,648 --> 00:00:03,148
(upbeat tone)

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,750
- [Instructor] Now we can
control the enemies spawning

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,970
whenever they all leave the scene.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,450
So what we're gonna do is

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,710
actually increase the
number of enemies every time

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,390
we defeat a wave.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,020
So, we'll have one spawn

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,280
and then we can have two spawn

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,623
and three, and so on.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,870
In our Spawn Manager
Script we're going to use

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,980
a variable to control the actual

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,440
number of enemies in the wave.

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,400
So, we'll make a Public Variable

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,690
so we can see what it does again,

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,690
make it an Integer, and then
we'll call it Wave Number,

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,290
and we'll set it to one in the beginning,

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,680
and then we'll actually use
this wave number to dictate

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,220
how many enemies should spawn after

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,650
we defeat every enemy.

20
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,210
In our If Statement, since
this is where we know

21
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,560
when enemies are defeated,

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,780
this is actually where we'll
increment our wave number.

23
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,820
So we'll change our spawn enemy wave

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,893
and start to be wave number,

25
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,240
so this will spawn one
enemy at the beginning.

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,560
Now, when we've defeated
all of the enemies

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,440
we'll set wave number and

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,180
we'll use that plus plus, this time.

29
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,920
So now when the enemies are all defeated,

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,230
it will increase wave number by one,

31
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,280
so now wave number should be two.

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,980
And then if we change the
enemies to spawn parameter,

33
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,130
to be a wave number here,

34
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,823
so then it should spawn
two enemies afterwards.

35
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,573
So, now if we test our game,

36
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,530
we should see one enemy
spawn; there we go.

37
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,790
And then if we hit this
enemy off, two enemies spawn.

38
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,260
Then see if we can hit both.

39
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,413
Oh, we have one.

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,470
And the last one

41
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,000
will go off and then do we get three?

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,933
And there you go.

43
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,400
So, now in your spawn manager script,

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,320
you're going to add another variable

45
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,573
to keep track of the wave number.

46
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,720
So we'll set it to one

47
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,810
and we'll make it public so
we can see what it's doing.

48
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,940
In our Start Method, change
enemy wave to wave number

49
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,370
and then in our Update Method,

50
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,600
where we can actually keep track

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,210
of when we hit the point
where all the enemies

52
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,060
are off the scene and we create a new one,

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,170
we'll increment wave number
by one here and then we'll

54
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,060
spawn a new enemy wave using
the incremented number.

55
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,828
Now it's your turn.

56
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:39,328
(upbeat tone)
