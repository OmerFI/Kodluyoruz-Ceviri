2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,240
- [Instructor] Our game
is almost complete now.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,740
So, when we pick up
the powerup, we can hit

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,450
the enemy off the scene and then

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,740
it will generate new
enemies, but the problem is,

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,950
we only have one powerup and
so when our powerup goes away

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,050
we have no way of actually
defeating these enemies unless

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,420
we outsmart them by getting them

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,293
to fall off of the platform.

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,260
So we're going to create
a new powerup every time

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,900
we start a new wave.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,660
In our spawn manager script,
we're actually going to declare

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,333
a new public game object for our powerup.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,120
And now we need to make sure
that this reference is assigned

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,900
in our editor.

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,900
So now in Unity, if we select
our spawn manager, you can see

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,640
that we have an empty game
object for our powerup prefab

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,890
so make sure you go down to
your project window under Assets

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,470
in your Prefabs folder.

20
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,160
Drag the power up into
that slot instead of using

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,000
the one in the scene and then back

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
in our spawn manager script,
in our line of code where

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,360
we keep track of when all
of the enemies are gone

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,490
and create new enemies, we'll instantiate

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,760
a new powerup prefab.

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,360
Fortunately, we created a
method to generate random spawn

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,540
positions so we can just use that again

28
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,940
and then we'll just make
sure to set the rotation

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,293
of our powerup prefab.

30
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,080
One thing that you could
do just to clean this up

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,120
a bit more is you could just
make a spawn powerup method

32
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,710
if you wanted to and then
every time you wanted to create

33
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,890
a new powerup, you can just
call that method instead,

34
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,680
but, for now, this one
line of code is fine.

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,520
And then just to test and see

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,650
that our powerup spawning
works properly, we'll delete

37
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,650
our powerup from the scene,
play our game, and now we spawn

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,760
the enemy, and we didn't spawn a powerup

39
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,593
so that's a problem.

40
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:09,820
I actually have -- well
that's pretty lucky

41
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,610
but that wasn't exactly
what we wanted to do.

42
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,950
Let's see what we did
wrong in our spawn manager.

43
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,240
Ahh, so when we start the game,
we create a new enemy wave

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,720
but we don't actually create a new powerup

45
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,880
so we'll take this line
of code and we'll copy it

46
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,660
so that in our start method we also create

47
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,780
a new random position
for our powerup prefab.

48
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,103
So now in our game,

49
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,093
if we try and get to our powerup.

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,363
Let's see, can we make it.

51
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,350
Enemy fell off anyways, got the powerup.

52
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,193
Another powerup spawns and there you go.

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,600
And then both enemies fall.

54
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,723
And then three enemies and two powerups.

55
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,080
So, what you're gonna do is
in your spawn manager script

56
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,410
you're going to create
a new public game object

57
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,170
for your powerup prefab.

58
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,220
In your start method,
you're going to instantiate

59
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,880
a new powerup prefab and you're gonna use

60
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,340
the generate spawn position
method once again so we get

61
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,770
a random position for
our powerup and then also

62
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,000
in our update method when
we create a new enemy wave

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,410
we'll create another
powerup so that we can use

64
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,760
it in case we need it.

65
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,936
So, now it's your turn.

66
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:27,769
