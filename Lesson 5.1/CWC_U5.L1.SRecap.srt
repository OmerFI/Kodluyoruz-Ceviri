1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,180
- [Narrator] So, we've got
makings of a solid foundation

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,030
for a game so when we press play you can

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,279
see all the different
objects thrown into the air.

4
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,654
When they get past the
sensor bar at the bottom

5
00:00:18,654 --> 00:00:22,933
they get removed, if we click
on them they also get removed.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,140
In this lesson we also learned about

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,527
using or 2D

8
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,073
verses or 3D view.

9
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:31,890
In this case since we're playing in 2D

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,040
it's a lot easier if we just look at our

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,610
entire view through the 2D one.

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,670
We learned how to also apply Torque

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,690
to the rigid bodies of our objects

14
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,150
in our target script.

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,860
We also created a Game Manager object

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,930
instead of a Bond Manager, because we'll

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,614
be using this actually control the state

18
00:00:51,614 --> 00:00:54,420
of our game as we add more to it.

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,680
In our Game Manager script
we learn how to use a list

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,860
in place of a raise

21
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,300
to be able to get different objects.

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,720
We reused our ienumerator on co-routine

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,810
and inside actually used a
While statement to be able

24
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,440
to control while something is happening

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,190
to keep iterating over our blocks of code

26
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,180
and keep doing them over and over again.

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,700
And then finally we learned how to use

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,250
a new method our "OnMouseDown",

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,010
so that whenever we get our mouse click we

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,820
can actually immediately
know when it's over

31
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,671
one of our objects and
we can destroy the game

32
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,640
object as a result.

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,830
In our next lesson we'll
make this game look

34
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,397
just a little bit better
by adding in some effects

35
00:01:35,397 --> 00:01:38,730
as well as keeping track of the score,

36
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,270
whenever we click on one
of these different objects.

37
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,620
See you on the next lesson.
