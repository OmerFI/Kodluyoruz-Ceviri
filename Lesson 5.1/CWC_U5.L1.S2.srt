00:00:00,879 --> 00:00:03,796
(electronic music)

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,020
- [Instructor] Now, the
first thing that we'll need

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,530
for this little game is three objects

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,420
that we're gonna collect

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,720
and then a bad object to avoid.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,263
So we're going to go
into our project window.

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,510
We're going to, under our assets folder,

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,930
expand our course library

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,290
and then in our course library,

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,220
we're going to expand our props.

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,760
Now you can see we have a
bunch of different options here

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,170
from bad things we don't
wanna collide with.

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,130
We have different balls we can use.

14
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,060
We have food.

15
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,410
There's other types of things.

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,710
So I think I'm just going to use

17
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,883
some of these other objects here.

18
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,480
So I like the look of all
of these different crates

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,173
so I'm gonna go and drag
them into my hierarchy.

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,530
And you can kinda see they're
stacking on top of each other

21
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,520
so we'll just go and
we'll use our move tool

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,470
and we'll just drag them onto
our scene so we can see them.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,640
And then we need a bad prop to use

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,790
so we'll go into props, bad
and we'll just click and drag.

25
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,860
I'll use a skull as one of my bad props.

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,040
That way it's very clear
which ones are good.

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,800
All of these different crates over here

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,950
and then we have our skull

29
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,500
which we definitely don't wanna press.

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,580
Now, we're going to
rename all of our props

31
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,570
so that way it's easier to manage them.

32
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,620
So we'll name the skull and
we'll just make this very simple

33
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,773
so we'll call this Bad 1
for the first bad prop.

34
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,680
And our crate, we'll name this Good 1,

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,063
so this is the first one.

36
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,580
We have Good 2

37
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,203
and then our last cube will be Good 3.

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,030
Now on all of our props,

39
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,600
we actually need rigid
bodies and box colliders

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,690
because this game is gonna
be a bunch of objects

41
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,510
being thrown up in the
air and then falling

42
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,440
and we need the physics for that.

43
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,380
And then we need colliders
because we're actually going to

44
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,440
add triggers to each
of these boxes as well.

45
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,010
So I'm going to select the first box

46
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,000
and then I'll select the
last item on the list

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,810
and I'm just going to add components

48
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,160
so I'll add a box collider

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,410
so hopefully it works
on all of them properly

50
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,523
and then I'll add a rigid body.

51
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,260
So now we have box colliders

52
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,260
and rigid bodies applied to all of them.

53
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,120
Just make sure they work properly

54
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,853
so you can see the box looks pretty close.

55
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,683
Cube also looks good.

56
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,813
That one looks good.

57
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:44,370
Let's see what happens with the bad.

58
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,733
Yeah, pretty well lined up.

59
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,010
Now, what we're gonna do
is in our assets folder,

60
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,440
we're going to right-click on it

61
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,080
and create a new folder

62
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,603
and this will be for our scripts.

63
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,730
And then in our scripts folder,

64
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,003
we're just going to make
a script called target.

65
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,400
And then we're going to select

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,980
all of our different objects as well

67
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,830
and they'll all use the same
target script in general

68
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,793
so we don't need to get
very fancy with this.

69
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,120
So now you can see they all
have the target script applied.

70
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,840
Now, in our assets folder,

71
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,170
we'll create a new
folder for our pre-fabs.

72
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,150
Now we're gonna take each
of our different objects

73
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,533
and we'll drag them into
our pre-fabs folder.

74
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,853
Make sure you create original pre-fabs.

75
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,320
And now, since we have
all of our pre-fabs,

76
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,260
I'll just go and delete

77
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,620
all of these objects in our scene now

78
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,780
'cause I don't think we'll
need to edit them much later

79
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,600
so delete and now we're good to go.

80
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,690
So what you're gonna do

81
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,680
is you're going to go into
your course library folder,

82
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,420
underneath props, you can pick a bad prop

83
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,490
that you're gonna use for your game

84
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,260
and then choose three other props.

85
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,120
They can be balls.

86
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,100
They can be food.

87
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,823
They can be any other kind
of prop that you wanna use.

88
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,900
Make sure on all of the props

89
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,640
you add a rigid body

90
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,770
and a collider

91
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,830
and then just make sure

92
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,400
that the collider is properly lined up

93
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,863
with the actual object you're using.

94
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,040
In our project window, create
a new folder for your scripts

95
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,060
and create a target script
that you'll then apply

96
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,150
to each of your different
objects on your scene.

97
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,490
Once you have the box collider,

98
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,100
the rigid body and your script applied,

99
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,680
create your pre-fabs folder,

100
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,820
drag and drop all of
your different objects

101
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,040
into your pre-fabs folder.

102
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,090
Create original pre-fabs

103
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,470
and then you can see all of
the different pre-fabs here

104
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,160
with all of the components applied.

105
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,121
So, now it's your turn.

106
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:05,038
