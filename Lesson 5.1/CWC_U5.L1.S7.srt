(text thrums)

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,100
- [Instructor] Now our objects

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,100
are all spawning using our
game manager, and every second,

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,293
you'll see a different
object being created.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,330
Now, you can see over on our hierarchy

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,280
that we have all of
these different objects

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,180
that are continually being
produced and not being destroyed,

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,790
so we'll need to destroy
them in two different ways,

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,180
so we'll actually get a register
for when we actually click

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,840
on one of these different
objects to delete it,

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,230
but then also, we need to destroy it

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,630
whenever it gets off of
what the player can see.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,500
Now that we're in our target script,

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,773
we're going to add in a new method.

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,980
In this case, we're going
to override a method

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,350
that Unity already has made for us,

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,133
which is really handy,
so if we private void,

18
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,093
now we can type OnMouseUp,
or we can type OnMouseDown.

19
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:06,023
I'll also type in OnMouseUp
just so you can see it.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,830
Now, because this
actually happens so often

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,800
in different games and
in different project,

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,170
Unity has already made a method to detect

23
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,120
whenever your mouse is
inside of a collider

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,423
of an object and you click down,

25
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,780
or if you let go of your click,

26
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,390
it will then fire off an event

27
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,350
that will then immediately use

28
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,420
whatever lines of code
are inside of this block.

29
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,050
Similarly for when we did key presses,

30
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,440
when you press the space bar down

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,440
or you let go of the space
bar, you could detect that,

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,950
and then you could fire
off a line of code.

33
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,410
In this case, we don't
have to program any of that

34
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,360
because we can just use these
functions that already exist.

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,600
I'll get rid of OnMouseUp,

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,800
and I'll just use OnMouseDown for now,

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,810
and so when the mouse is down
inside one of our objects,

38
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,803
we will then destroy that game object.

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,800
Just to test our OnMouseDown, let's see,

40
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,673
if we play our game,

41
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,300
you can see the boxes going up in the air,

42
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,110
I clicked in the wrong place.

43
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,810
One's gone, two, three,

44
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,280
four,

45
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,710
five.

46
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,070
And now you can see,

47
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,820
we can delete them when we click on them,

48
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,300
however, they're still getting created,

49
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,170
and they're not being removed

50
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,320
when they actually
leave the player's view.

51
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,773
Helpfully, in our project,

52
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,550
we actually already have a
empty game object created

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,380
called a sensor, and it has a box collider

54
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,380
already applied to it that has a trigger,

55
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,690
so in our target script,

56
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,820
we can actually use the
OnTriggerEnter method,

57
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,230
since the sensor is the only thing

58
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,880
that has a trigger applied to it.

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,750
And then when one of our objects

60
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,003
enters the trigger for that
sensor, we can destroy it.

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,620
One thing you might've noticed, too,

62
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,130
when we were playing our game,

63
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,620
is that the boxes were
spawning a little bit too low,

64
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,700
so fortunately, since we saved

65
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,850
the Y spawn position as a variable,

66
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,830
if we just move up the boxes a little bit,

67
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,163
maybe to, let's call a negative two,

68
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,530
now you can see when we test our game,

69
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,903
our boxes should spawn
a little bit higher,

70
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,240
and then, when they run into the collider,

71
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,833
they get removed when
they enter the trigger.

72
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,110
One thing you might notice
in our target script

73
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,090
is in our overridden variables,

74
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,640
you'll see the private keyword,

75
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,160
however, in our custom methods,

76
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,960
you'll see that we don't
use the private keyword.

77
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,840
A really nice thing about
scripts is, in fact,

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,490
if we don't state that
something is private or public,

79
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,050
it'll automatically
actually make our variables,

80
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,973
if they're global, or our methods private.

81
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,360
What you're gonna do is,
in your target script,

82
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,110
you're going to create an
OnMouseDown overridden method,

83
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,550
and in that method, you're going
to destroy the game object,

84
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,330
so that way, when our mouse
is inside the collider

85
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,520
of one of our objects, when
we click our mouse down,

86
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,380
it'll actually destroy that game object,

87
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,240
and similarly, you'll create
an OnTriggerEnter method

88
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,400
where, when one of the game objects runs

89
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,800
into the sensor at the
bottom of our scene,

90
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,900
it'll destroy that game object, too.

91
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,594
Now it's your turn.

92
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:51,094
