00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,690
(tech-sounding chimes)

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,900
- [Instructor] We've
got a for-loop set up,

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,070
so now when we press play,

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,293
you can see the three different
enemies spawning around.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,280
If we're going to increase the number

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,314
of enemies that spawn in our game,

7
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:21,070
we'll actually need to be
able to pass information

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,943
to our method using parameters.

9
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:25,750
In our spawn manager script,

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,750
we have our SpawnEnemyWave method.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,330
Now, how do we actually add parameters

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,770
to our method, so that way

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,760
we can tell it numbers of enemies

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,530
that we want to spawn over time?

15
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,240
In fact, it's fairly easy.

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,150
What we can do is, we can type in

17
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:42,513
int enemiesToSpawn,

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,530
and now this creates an
enemiesToSpawn variable

19
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,910
that we can then use throughout our code.

20
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,820
So, instead of ending
or for-loop when i < 3,

21
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,240
we can end our for-loop

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,627
when i < enemiesToSpawn .

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,910
We've been using
parameters the entire time

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,490
with a lot of our methods,

25
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,180
to be able to pass in information

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,330
like enemyPrefab, or transform.rotation,

27
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,300
and in this case, we can use something

28
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,270
as simple as a integer variable

29
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,990
to pass in the number of enemies

30
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,320
that we want to spawn,

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,450
every time we call this method.

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,320
One thing you'll notice

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,430
is our SpawnEnemyWave method

34
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,560
at our Start method

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,810
is pretty angry with us right now,

36
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,930
because it actually needs
a number to start with.

37
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,170
So, we can press 3,

38
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,460
and now when we play our game,

39
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,393
we should just see three
enemies spawn once again.

40
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,370
So, you can see that adding parameters

41
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,880
to our methods can be
a fairly easy process.

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,710
Then, if we wanted to, we could just use

43
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,390
something as simple as a comma,

44
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,230
and state another random thing

45
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,350
to be able to use a second variable.

46
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,890
And, we can add in as many
parameters as we want,

47
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,670
but it's best to keep the parameters

48
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,280
to as minimum as possible

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,560
so that way you're not using

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,040
too many things, if you don't need to.

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,769
One other point to mention here,

52
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:10,190
you can see that here
in our SpawnEnemyWave,

53
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,280
we have a "void" method,

54
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,040
and then in our GenerateSpawnPosition,

55
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,320
we have a "Vector3".

56
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,740
So, you can see here

57
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,480
the difference in when
you would really use

58
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,660
a "void" method, versus a
method that returns something.

59
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,860
Where with our GenerateSpawnPosition,

60
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,590
we want it to give us information

61
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,420
on a random position
that we want to generate,

62
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,930
versus our SpawnEnemyWave
method is just doing something.

63
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,810
In this case, doing the task

64
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,210
of creating different numbers of enemies,

65
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,830
based on how many enemies we want.

66
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,410
In this case too,

67
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,580
we need a parameter to tell SpawnEnemyWave

68
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,430
how many enemies we want to spawn,

69
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,350
but, in our GenerateSpawnPosition,

70
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,330
we don't need any parameters

71
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,800
because it's already doing

72
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,320
all the calculations inside of the method.

73
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,870
So, what you're gonna do is,

74
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,100
in your SpawnEnemyWave method,

75
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,200
you're going to add a parameter,

76
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,730
which is a int of the
number of enemiesToSpawn.

77
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,630
You're going to replace the 3

78
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,200
in i < 3 of your for-loop,

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,730
with the enemiesToSpawn variable,

80
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,040
and then in your "Start" method,

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,640
just make sure that in SpawnEnemyWave,

82
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,300
you add an integer in there

83
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,558
to tell the method how many enemies

84
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:23,010
you want to spawn.

85
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,435
Now it's your turn.

86
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:27,685
