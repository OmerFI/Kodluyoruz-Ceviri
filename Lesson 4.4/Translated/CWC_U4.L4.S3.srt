1
00:00:00,472 --> 00:00:03,805
(computerized chirping)

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,570
- [Narrator] So, we're
using loops to control

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,920
all of the spawning of our enemies

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,350
but one of the things that we have to do,

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,440
is we actually need to make it

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,880
so when all of these enemies fall off,

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,980
you can see they still exist in our scene.

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,870
So actually, I need to remove them

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,500
and then we'll add in some functionality

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,503
to spawn new waves.

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,840
First what we're gonna do
is in our enemy script,

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,310
we're going to remove the enemies

13
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,730
when they fall off the scene.

14
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,210
So we'll do that in our Update method

15
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,870
so we can always check their position.

16
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,730
So, if the enemy's current position

17
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,350
on the y becomes less than negative 10,

18
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,040
so if it falls below
plane of our platform,

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,650
then we'll destroy the
current game object, cool?

20
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,420
So now, in our SpawnManager,

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,880
since we know that our
enemies will be destroyed

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,853
when they leave the platform,

23
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,740
we actually want to
keep track of the number

24
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,030
of enemies that we have.

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,600
So, we're going to make
a public variable for now

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,780
so we can see the numbers of enemies

27
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,370
that are the screen.

28
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,400
We'll make it an int

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,174
and then we'll just call it enemyCount

30
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:13,760
so we can keep track.

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,870
In our Update method,

32
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,930
is actually where we're
going to be keeping the count

33
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,170
of all of our enemies.

34
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,030
They will be deleted at
different points in time,

35
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,030
so we use enemyCount and we'll
set this using a new method

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,870
to find all of the enemies in the scene.

37
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,243
So, if we use FindObjectsOfType.

38
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,150
So, in this case, this
method will be looking for

39
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,700
all of the different objects in our scene,

40
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,440
but now we can actually use our script

41
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,800
to be able to find all of those objects.

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,270
So we'll actually use the Enemy script,

43
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,980
since all of our enemies will be spawning

44
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,120
with that script on it.

45
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,960
So, similar to how you use GetComponent

46
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,160
and that type of component.

47
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,110
With FindObjectsOfType,
you can use the name

48
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,940
of the scripts applied
to those game objects

49
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,720
to find those objects.

50
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,860
And now, you can see
we have a problem here.

51
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,690
So, this is actually a really useful part

52
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,653
of knowing the difference
between return and void now.

53
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,020
So actually, if we hover
over FindObjectsOfType,

54
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,870
you can see that first
word says it returns

55
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,780
an array of enemies and the problem here

56
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,110
is that it can't actually
set an array of enemies

57
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,240
to an integer.

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,100
You need an integer to set an integer.

59
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,500
So actually, because this is an array,

60
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,060
we can actually use the Length method.

61
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,280
And so now length will
actually return the number

62
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,930
of enemy objects in our scene.

63
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,190
So now that we can keep track
of all the different enemies,

64
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,480
we'll need to know when we
should spawn more enemies.

65
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,950
So, we'll use an if statement

66
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,950
to track that condition, so
if the enemyCount ever becomes

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,690
or, using our comparison operator here

68
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,510
with the two equal signs, zero,

69
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,670
then we should spawn more enemies.

70
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,690
And just to see and make sure it works,

71
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,470
I'll set this to one for now.

72
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,530
So after all three of our
enemies fall off the scene,

73
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,920
our Enemy Count should hit zero

74
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,670
and then it will spawn one more enemy.

75
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,120
So now in Unity, if I
select our Spawn Manager

76
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,700
in our project hierarchy you can see

77
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,583
that the current Enemy Count is zero.

78
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,853
When I play our game,

79
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,670
you can see three enemies
spawn, I pick up the power-up,

80
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,680
one enemy falls off, two
enemies, three enemies fall off,

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,670
get set to zero, and then
it sets it back to one

82
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,210
because it spawns a new enemy.

83
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,050
So, what you're gonna do
is in your enemy script,

84
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,870
you're going to add some lines of code

85
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,440
just to detect when an
enemy falls off the scene

86
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,873
to be destroyed, in our Update method.

87
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,920
In our SpawnManager script,

88
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,260
you're going to create a new variable.

89
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,810
We'll make it public for
now so we can see it change.

90
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,050
We'll make it an integer
called enemyCount.

91
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,830
In our Update method, we're
going to set enemyCount

92
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,800
by finding ObjectsOfType,
and the type we're gonna use

93
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,660
is actually the enemy script.

94
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,360
And then we need to get the Length

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,970
of what that returns
because it actually gives us

96
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,490
an array and we just need a number.

97
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,970
Then we're gonna create
a new if statement,

98
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,414
using the enemyCount.

99
00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:32,910
And when enemyCount becomes zero,

100
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,520
then we'll spawn a new
enemy wave with one enemy.

101
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,913
So, now it's your turn.
