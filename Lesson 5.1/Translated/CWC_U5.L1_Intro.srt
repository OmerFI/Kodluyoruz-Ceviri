(futuristic music)

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,960
- In this prototype, objects
will be tossed into the air,

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,860
and the user has to click
on them to destroy them.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,830
So, the first thing you'll do is decide

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,780
what kind of objects
you want to obliterate.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,610
You could choose between sports balls.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,970
You could choose fruits and veggies.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,250
You could even choose the ingredients

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,380
from my favorite healthy breakfast,

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,130
pizza, cookies, and energy drinks.

11
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,400
Whatever you choose,

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,800
by the end of this lesson
the objects you want

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,580
will be launched into the air,

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,030
and when you click on
them, they'll be destroyed.

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,540
To make this game as fun
and fast-paced as possible,

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,600
we're going to give these
objects not one, not two,

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,500
but three randomized variables.

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,440
The position along the
bottom of the screen

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,310
will be randomized so the
objects can appear from anywhere.

20
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,390
The upward force will be randomized

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,830
so that the objects fly
up to random heights.

22
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,120
And the spin or torque we apply

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,360
will also be randomized so that
some objects spin this way,

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,560
some spin that way,

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,930
and some barely spin at all.

26
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,980
As you can imagine,

27
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,500
our old friend Random.Range is
going to be heavily involved

28
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,860
in all of this.

29
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,860
To destroy the objects,

30
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,630
we'll also be testing for a
brand new type of user input,

31
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,463
the mouse.

32
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,290
Unity can easily detect

33
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,410
where and when a mouse has
been clicked in your game.

34
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,330
You can tell when the
mouse enters an area.

35
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,840
You can tell when the mouse
button has been pressed down.

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,240
You can even tell when the
mouse button has been released.

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,560
All you have to do is
detect if a user has clicked

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,020
one of our objects,

39
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,233
and if they have, we'll destroy it.

40
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,130
So, to make all that happen,

41
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,363
I'll see you in Unity.

42
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:46,953
