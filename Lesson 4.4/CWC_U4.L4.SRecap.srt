1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,380
- We've got a lot of great functionality

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,210
in this game now for this prototype.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,460
So we have the player that spawns.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,470
We have our enemy.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,358
We have the power-up that we can pick up.

6
00:00:14,358 --> 00:00:16,520
We have the indicator and then

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,070
we have the timer that counts down,

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,710
so we bounce off of all of these enemies.

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,840
And with every new enemy wave we spawn

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,763
new power-ups.

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,560
On top of that we learned
some really useful

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,900
coding concepts.

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,140
We learned about For-loops

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,910
to keep control over the number of times

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,110
we want something to execute.

16
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,420
In this case our instantiate method

17
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,650
so that we can spawn
different numbers of enemies

18
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,990
every time the player defeats one.

19
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,060
In order to actually increment the number

20
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,190
of enemies we want to spawn,

21
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,720
we learned how to use the (++) or

22
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,800
incremental operator,

23
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,010
so then that way we
can increase I plus one

24
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,530
every time this For-Loop runs.

25
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,770
We also created our own custom method.

26
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,240
This time with a parameter to pass in,

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,090
so then that way we could keep track of

28
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,220
the number of enemies to spawn

29
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,380
based on our wave number.

30
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,750
And then in our update method

31
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,690
we learned how to use FindObjectsOfType

32
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,620
so that we could get any object

33
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,040
with a type of our enemies script.

34
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,270
So then we could actually get the

35
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,440
number of enemies that are in our scene.

36
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,820
Last but not least with
the end of the prototype

37
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,000
we've learned a lot of
really useful things,

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,070
like using I enumerators and co-routines

39
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,180
so in that way we can actually
have a countdown timer

40
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,340
for our power-up

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,193
so then eventually it goes away.

42
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,310
We learned how to use physical materials

43
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,870
so that way we can have a bouncy effect

44
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,520
so when these different spheres run into

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,140
each other they'll
bounce off of each other

46
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,973
even more.

47
00:01:50,198 --> 00:01:52,483
We learned how to really
use camera control.

48
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,910
And learned about child game objects to

49
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,760
control this camera around a focal point

50
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,410
in our scene.

51
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,410
And then we learned how to use vector math

52
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,990
to actually control the direction that

53
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,810
these enemies are moving towards

54
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,170
so that they eventually
run into the player.

55
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,070
With that we've made it to
the end of our prototype

56
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,970
and we'll see you in the next project.
